# NoTargetAFK

> Prevents mobs from targeting AFK players.

# What is this?

Essentials AFK status does not protect you from mobs. You can of course enable
freeze function, but mobs will still try to attack you: skeletons will shoot
arrows, creepers come close and explode.

This plugin changes that. Now, whenever you go AFK, all mobs just lose 
interest in you. They will still spawn, and wander around you, but won't 
target or attack you like you don't exist or one of their own.

# Usage

Install alongside the Essentials plugin. This plugin currently does not have
configuration or permissions, these will probably be added in the future.
